# rubicCubeSolver
As a rubic cube's enthusiast sooner or later I would come up with some app about it.
My goal is to learn and play with code combine with my passion.

It's a desktop app that allows user to play with cubes.
Funcionalities:
  - scramble cube with randomly generated algorithm
  - move cube with your own algorithm
  - solve cube using basic solving method
  - finding shortest algorith which solves the cube (FWM - fewest moves)
  - shorten algorithm, with option of deleting rotation moves
  - hiostry of actions taken by user
  - setting delay between single moves

Current type of cubes available:
  - 2x2x2 full funcionality
  
Program is write in JAVA version 12, with help of liblaries: AWT, swing, GUAVA, Lombok, JavaTuples.
Build using Maven. Test are written in JUnit5.
